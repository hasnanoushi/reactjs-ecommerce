    <h1>What is FarHan  CliQ?</h1>
    <p>FarHan  CliQ is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
    FarHan CliQ has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
    when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type 
    specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
     electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in 
     the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing FarHan CliQ CliQ passages, 
     and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including 
     versions of FarHan CliQ .</p>
    
    <h1>Why do we use it?</h1>
    <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable 
    content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using FarHan CliQ  is
     that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 
     'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing 
     packages and web page editors now use FarHan  CliQ as their default model text, and a search for 
     'FarHan CliQ ' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over
      the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose injected humour and the like.</p>
    
    <h1>
    Where does it come from?</h1>
    <p>ontrary to popular belief, FarHan  CliQ is not simply random text.
     It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making 
     it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College
      in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a
       FarHan CliQ CliQ passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature
       , discovered the undoubtable source. FarHan CliQ  comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.
       10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" the Extremes of Good and Evil by Cicero,
        written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics,
     very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of FarHan  CliQ, "FarHan CliQ 
      dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
